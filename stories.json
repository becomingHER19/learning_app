  "The Clever Fox": "Once upon a time, a clever fox lived in a dense forest. One day, he saw a bunch of juicy grapes hanging from a vine. He jumped and jumped but could not reach them. Finally, he walked away saying, 'Those grapes are probably sour anyway.' The fox learned that sometimes its better to accept things we cant have.",
  
  "The Brave Little Elephant": "In a vast jungle, a little elephant named Tanu was afraid of everything — even butterflies! One day, when a lion got trapped in a net, all the animals ran away. But Tanu gathered courage and used his trunk to tear the net and free the lion. From that day, he was known as the bravest elephant in the jungle.",
  
  "The Magic Tree": "In a small village, there stood a tree that granted gifts to those with pure hearts. Every child in the village tried their luck, but only little Mira, who wished not for toys but for her sick mothers health, received a golden fruit that healed her. The villagers learned that kindness and love make the real magic.",
  
  "The Lost Puppy": "A boy named Rohan found a lost puppy shivering in the rain. He brought it home, fed it, and cared for it. Days later, he saw a poster of the missing puppy and returned it to its owner. The puppys owner thanked him with a big smile — and Rohan felt the joy of doing the right thing.",
  
  "The Tiny Seed": "A tiny seed was always sad because it was small. One day, the wind carried it far away to an open field. It grew into a big, beautiful sunflower. The seed realized that even small things can grow into something wonderful with time and patience."
